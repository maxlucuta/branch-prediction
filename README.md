## Overview

Semi-static conditions emulate traditional conditional statements, but seperate condition evaluation logic and branch taking into two distinct methods. This seperation produces an important decoupling between
relatively cheap and expensive operations,  allowing for more strategic and granular control over conditional branching in low latency settings. Semi-static conditions offers superior branch-taking latencies
and standard deviations to conditional statements when misprediction rates are high.
